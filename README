prerequisites
-------------

### Option 1: Use my repository

By default, the pom.xml has a repository configured, that is pointing to a public dropbox directory where I have uploaded all the dependencies needed in this pom.xml

You don´t need to do anything to use this option. Just understand that maybe some day this directory won´t exist.

### Option 2: Generate all the dependencies

Delete my repository from the pom.xml and follow the same steps that I did to generate the dependencies in my local repository.

Go to this link and follow the steps: [maven-android-sdk-deployer](https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer)

Delete unused dependencies
--------------------------

If you are not going to use all the dependencies listed above, delete them from the pom.xml
